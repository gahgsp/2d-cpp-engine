# C++ 2D Engine with SDL2 + Lua

### What is this?
A 2D engine developed from scratch using courses and tutorials about C++ and SDL2.2D

### Why?
To get a better grasp on how the games run under the hood and also to learn more in depth C++ and SDL2.

### Is it finished?
No, this will be a long WIP! The engine already can handle the game I've developed but there are features that can be improved. As I keep progressing on my studies in C++, I will try to apply what I learned to improve the this code.
